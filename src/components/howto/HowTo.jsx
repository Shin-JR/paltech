          Welcome to the GeoFences & Markers Web App Tutorial!
        </h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This tutorial will guide you through the basic usage of the GeoFences
          & Markers Paltech web app. The app allows you to create geofences,
          keep out zones, add markers, and more, all on an interactive map
          interface.
        </p>
        <h2>Markers</h2>
        <h3>Add Markers</h3>
        <h2>Adding Markers</h2>
        <p>
          To add markers, click on the "Handle Markers" button on the sidebar.
          Then, click on the map to place markers. You can also remove markers
          by selecting the "Remove a marker" option.
        </p>
        <h2>Deleting All Markers</h2>
        <p>
          If you need to delete all markers from the map, simply click on the
          "Remove All Markers" button from the sidebar.
        </p>

        <h3>Delete Markers</h3>
        <h2>Geofences</h2>
        <h3>Adding Geofences</h3>
        <p>
          To add a geofence, click on the "Handle Geofences" button on the
          sidebar. Then, click on the map to create the vertices of your
          geofence. Once you've created the desired shape, the geofence will be
          displayed on the map.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding Keep Out Zones</h2>
        <p>
          Similar to adding geofences, you can add keep out zones by selecting
          the "Add Keep Out Zone" button from the sidebar. Follow the same steps
          as adding geofences to create your keep out zones.
        </p>
        <h2>Deleting Geofences</h2>
        <p>
          To delete a geofence, click on the "Delete Geofence" button from the
          sidebar. Then, click on the geofence you want to delete. The geofence
          will be removed from the map.
        </p>
        <h2>Deleting All Geofences</h2>
        <p>
          If you need to delete all geofences from the map, simply click on the
          "Remove All Geofences" button from the sidebar.
        </p>

        <h2>Downloading Data</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, you can download all the geofences and markers data in JSON
          format. Click on the "Download JSON" button from the sidebar to export
          the data.
        </p>
